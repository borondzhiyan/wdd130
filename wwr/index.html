                <p>Water rafting, also known as whitewater rafting, has a rich history that dates back centuries. Originating from indigenous cultures using rafts for transportation and trade, water rafting evolved into a popular recreational activity in the mid-19th century. European explorers and settlers began navigating rivers for fun and adventure, leading to the development of modern rafting techniques and equipment. In the mid-20th century, commercial outfitters started offering guided rafting trips, making the sport more accessible to the public. Today, water rafting is a global phenomenon, with enthusiasts seeking out thrilling rapids and breathtaking scenery in destinations around the world. The history of water rafting showcases its evolution from a practical means of travel to an exhilarating outdoor adventure enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
